You're analyzing the objectives and scoring parameters from Ludeo.com, a cloud gaming platform where players share short playable moments (10-40 seconds) called "Ludeos".

I'll provide you with two JSON structures:
1. "objective" - {objective}
2. "score_params" - {score_params}

Your task is to create a clear, concise description that:
1. Explains the primary goal(s) the player must achieve
2. Details how points are earned and any bonus objectives
3. Uses natural, player-friendly language that's easy to understand

Focus on extracting key information:
- Primary objective (e.g., kills, headshots, time-based goals)
- Target numbers (how many kills/headshots needed)
- Scoring mechanisms (time bonuses, special kill types)
- Any special conditions or bonuses

Keep your response concise (under 20 words) and action-oriented, using direct language that would appeal to gamers. Include both the primary objective and scoring opportunities in your description.

Examples of good outputs:
- "Eliminate 4 enemies with headshots. Complete faster for a higher score."
- "Defeat 5 enemies in 45 seconds. Earn bonus points for headshots and completing quickly."
- "Get 3 headshots. Earn maximum points by finishing quickly without taking damage."
- "reach at least 14 kills in 30 seconds. if you get hit - game over!"

make sure the output your provide is only one or two sentences like showed in output
